# Final\_XO (Tic-Tac-Toe with AI)

## Overview

Final\_XO is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent implemented using the Minimax algorithm. The game is built using **Pygame** and provides a simple yet engaging interface for players to compete against an AI that makes optimal moves.

## Features

- **Player vs AI Mode**: Compete against an AI opponent.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI makes strategic moves to maximize its chances of winning.
- **Graphical Interface**: Built using Pygame, with a clean and responsive UI.
- **Win/Tie Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie.
- **Blurred Background on Game End**: A visual effect to highlight the game result.
- **Restart Button**: Allows players to restart the game after a match.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably **Python 3.8.10** or later).
2. Install **Pygame** if you haven't already:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
